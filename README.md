# my_monopoly
**NOTE: This project is in early development and is ongoing**

My own version of monopoly created with PySide6

This project depends on another module of mine: <a href="https://github.com/TPassmore/pp_core">pp_core</a>

To run the project, please clone both modules in to a directory and within that directory create and run a python file with the following code:
```
from my_monopoly.mo_ui import mo_app
mo_app.App()
```
